## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

##### 1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

In the Observer pattern, traits typically enforce a shared structure across subscribers. However, since BambangShop’s subscribers are external services receiving HTTP POST notifications, there’s no need for polymorphism or method overriding. A simple Subscriber struct containing url and name is sufficient.

##### 2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

DashMap is preferred over Vec as it enables fast lookups and guarantees uniqueness without requiring manual iteration. Additionally, it supports concurrent access, making it well-suited for managing multiple threads interacting with subscriber data.

##### 3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

While the Singleton pattern ensures a single instance, it does not inherently provide thread safety. DashMap, designed for concurrent access, allows multiple threads to modify data efficiently. Combining it with lazy_static! ensures both thread safety and centralized management of the subscriber list.

##### 1. In the Model-View Controller (MVC) compound pattern, there is no “Service” and “Repository”. Model in MVC covers both data storage and business logic. Explain based on your understanding of design principles, why we need to separate “Service” and “Repository” from a Model?

Separating "Service" and "Repository" from the Model aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring each component serves a distinct purpose. The Repository manages data access and persistence, abstracting database interactions, while the Service layer handles business logic, keeping it independent of data storage. This approach improves modularity, testability, and maintainability, as modifications to database structures or business rules do not directly affect the Model, minimizing complexity and reducing potential errors.


##### 2. What happens if we only use the Model? Explain your imagination on how the interactions between each model (Program, Subscriber, Notification) affect the code complexity for each model?

Relying solely on the Model for both data storage and business logic results in tightly coupled code that is harder to maintain. It increases complexity by making each Model responsible for data access, validation, and business logic, leading to bloated code. Additionally, shared logic such as validation or notifications would be duplicated across models, raising the risk of inconsistencies. Managing dependencies between models also becomes more difficult, making refactoring and testing more challenging. This violates SRP and ultimately limits system scalability.


##### 3. Have you explored more about Postman? Tell us how this tool helps you to test your current work. You might want to also list which features in Postman you are interested in or feel like it is helpful to help your Group Project or any of your future software engineering projects.

Postman is an essential tool for testing REST APIs by simulating HTTP requests and verifying responses without requiring a frontend. It offers features like Collections to systematically organize API endpoints, Environment Variables to facilitate smooth transitions between development and production settings, and Automated Testing through test scripts to ensure expected API behavior after updates. Additionally, Mock Servers help simulate API responses, enabling integration testing without relying on a live backend. These capabilities make Postman a powerful resource for debugging, testing, and ensuring API reliability in both individual and collaborative development environments.
